## Agents Council MCP migration notes (v2 session targeting)

Agents Council now requires explicit `session_id` targeting for existing-session operations.

- `start_council`: creates a session and returns `session_id`
- `join_council`: requires `session_id`
- `get_current_session_data`: requires `session_id`
- `send_response`: requires `session_id`
- `close_council`: requires `session_id`

Migration guidance:

1. Store `session_id` returned by `start_council`.
2. Pass that `session_id` on all join/get/send/close calls.
3. Update clients to handle explicit target errors:
   - missing `session_id`
   - `Session not found.`
   - `Council session is closed.` / `Council session is already closed.`

See `docs/council.md` for tool-level examples and MCP Inspector validation commands.

## Occult v1 reading tools

When `OCCULT_ENABLED=true`, the MCP server additively registers four
session-authorized tools:

- `occult_create_reading_v1`
- `occult_get_reading_v1`
- `occult_cancel_reading_v1`
- `occult_resume_reading_v1`

They require contract version `1.0.0`; create/resume accept cancellation, and
inspect supports incremental `after_sequence` cursors. No Occult tools are
registered when the feature is disabled. See `docs/occult-interfaces.md` for
payloads, authorization, CLI equivalents, UI behavior, and rollback.
