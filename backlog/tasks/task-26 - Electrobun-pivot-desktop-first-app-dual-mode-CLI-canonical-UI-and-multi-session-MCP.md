## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Deliver the product pivot from web UI + Bun-compiled CLI to an Electrobun desktop architecture while retaining terminal-based CLI use, adopting the canonical "Design Council Hall Interface", and enabling multi-session workflows with MCP session selection.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Launching the built app directly opens the desktop Council interface by default on supported platforms.
- [x] #2 Invoking the binary from terminal preserves CLI usage for council operations, including MCP server startup behavior.
- [x] #3 The production UI uses the canonical Council Sidebar + Council Hall structure from the design bundle and is wired to real council data/operations.
- [x] #4 Council state supports multi-session workflows with explicit session targeting in MCP interactions.
- [ ] #5 Distribution remains a single user-facing npm package with platform-specific optional dependency packages and cross-platform release validation.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Cross-platform smoke validation covers desktop launch mode and terminal CLI mode on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- [x] #2 Upgrade notes document MCP contract changes and migration expectations for clients.
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
Week 1: TASK-26.1 (architecture + compatibility ADR) to lock runtime modes, design-bundle remediation, and platform constraints.

Week 2: TASK-26.2 (Electrobun scaffold + dual-mode entrypoints) and TASK-26.3 (multi-session core schema/service) begin after TASK-26.1.

Week 3-4: TASK-26.4 evolves MCP contract for explicit session targeting after TASK-26.3. TASK-26.5 builds desktop bridge after TASK-26.2 + TASK-26.3.

Week 5: TASK-26.6 ports canonical Council Hall UI and wires real data/summon flows after TASK-26.5.

Week 6: TASK-26.7 completes CI/release/npm packaging migration after TASK-26.2 + TASK-26.4, including required developer/release documentation updates in the same implementation task.

Documentation workflow decision:
- Documentation updates are embedded in the owning implementation tasks (TASK-26.2, TASK-26.4, TASK-26.7) rather than a standalone docs-only follow-up task.

Delivery decisions locked with user:
- Timeline horizon: 6 weeks.
- Rollout scope: all platforms now.
- CLI behavior priority: preserve existing terminal contract.
- UI migration mode: canonical design + full functional integration.
- Session scope: multi-session now.
- Requirement priority: allow MCP contract changes to support session selection.
- Packaging: single user-facing npm package with platform optional dependency packages.
- `council chat`: retained as alias to desktop app behavior.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Post-launch reconciliation: TASK-26.1 through TASK-26.6 are shipped and now finalized with current CI and v0.5.2 release evidence. Desktop-default launch, CLI and MCP parity, canonical Council Hall integration, multi-session state, explicit session targeting, cross-platform smoke validation, and MCP migration notes are complete. TASK-26.7 remains open solely for the intentionally deferred npm publication and registry install-sanity policy; the parent remains In Progress until that public distribution decision and implementation are complete.
